# binary-tree-max-sum
Binary tree maximum sum path implementation

Assuming that in given triangle input, a child node can have two parents. For example in given scenario:\
```
192 124
117 269 442
```
269 node can potentially have 124 as parent and 192 as parent. Both will traverse 269 node to find maximum sum path.
